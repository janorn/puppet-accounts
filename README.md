# Puppet Accounts

## Description

This module is designed to store your system admins account information in hiera.
This is _not_ intended to be used to do large scale user deployments (you can try),
but rather for managing a small group of people that need to be able to login when
ldap servers die (for example).

## Requirements

* hiera

## Usage

TBD
